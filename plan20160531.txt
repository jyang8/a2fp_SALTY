PLAN:

core functionality:
-traversing through priorityqueue
-popping out unneeded answers
-choosing questions to ask next, based on previous response

extras:
-the "don't know" option, go through both yes and no answers if one path doesn't result in the correct answer
-using processing to make the program more visually attractive
-allowing player to add their own answers to the program


*Implementing the core functionality should be discussed within the group, the extras can be added on individually 
after the foundational methods are put into place. 

// NOTE: These diagrams are not all-encompassing, just a rough sketch


public class Driver {

//instance vars

PriorityQueue<Character> posAnswers  //to be questioned

PriorityQueue<Character> rejAnswers  // popped answers from posAnswers

PriorityQueue<Character> idkAnswers //when user chooses don’t no (go down yes or no path and pop other answers here for future use)

PriorityQueue<String> questions //remove question after it has been asked

}


public class Character implements Comparable { //eg PRESIDENT

//instance vars examples

boolean real;

boolean male;

boolean modern;

boolean foughtWar;

boolean scandal;

String party;


//methods

Accessors for the variables

int compareTo( Character c );

}


BACKEND:

•Uses priority queues for prioritizing the questions the user gets


•Uses comparable objects with a unique set of instance variables that distinguish the objects from one another


•Answers → check if the instance var corresponding to the question is a specific value ( E.g. Is this person real or fake? || boolean real true; )



FRONTEND:

Processing for the display window

•Shows clickable buttons (yes, no, don’t know)


•Shows question (questions go from general to specific)


•Shows mascot (Possibilities: Mr. Salt & Ms. Pepper, “Mud”, etc.)


•Shows image of character that the program thinks the user is thinking of (finding an image on Google)


•Ability to input correct responses and expand the database (when no correct answer is generated, give option to add answer)
